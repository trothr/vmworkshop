VM Workshop Archival

## vmworkshop

The name of this project is "vmworkshop" because its purpose
is to create a mirror of z/VM and VM/CMS tools under a directory by that name.
The idea is that archives of CMS and z/VM tools, presentations, and packages
can be deliverd on a CD and that supporters can maintain their own mirrors.
